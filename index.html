                    <p>Hi! I’m Jake, a 2025 Mechanical Engineering graduate and EIT from Merrimack College, currently 
                    working at Quest Global (contracted to GE Vernova) as a Gas Turbine Controls Engineer. I’m interested in robotics, 
                    control systems, and their real-world applications. I've worked in industry
                    since July, 2025 gaining experience in an Agile Scrum based team integrating standard and site specific software 
                    for new gas turbine units. I've learned to investigate errors and manage risks with newly integrated products
                    through communication between disciplenes solving problems collaboratively. My robotics experience comes from my time as a student which includes implementing 
                    an Extended Kalman Filter in MATLAB Simulink for sensor fusion on a skid-steer mobile robot. I 
                    also served as a research assistant studying Human-Robot Interaction, exploring library patrons’ 
                    reactions to Pepper, a social robot, with customized story-reading scripts.  </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm always exploring ways to use my knowledge to solve complex problems, learning more skills in the process. Through work experience and 
                        eventual graduate study, I want to become a technical
                        lead in control theory helping solve the most difficult problems facing the industry. On top of enjoying solving complex problems, 
                        my experience teaching STEM topics as a tutor at Merrimack College developed my desire to mentor and teach, and I plan to take this mindset 
                        to any role I work. I take pride in my ability to communicate and teach effectively, and aspire to become a mentor to younger engineers
                        as I progress through my career. Additionally, the culture of a workplace is important to me, and I'm looking to join a diverse team of motivated engineers
                        who are respectful of eachother and collaborative in their work. I’m currently seeking a role in the Boston area related to robotics, autonomous 
                        systems, and control, where I can work with smart and driven coworkers, maintaining humility and learning to become reliable problem solver.

                    <a href="projects/Odom_Project.html">
                        Senior Design: Odometry and Sensor Fusion
                    </a> – Built a skid steered robot with tracking wheels, a gyroscope, and a camera for position
                    tracking. Implimented an Extended Kalman Filter that took the Odometry system (tracking wheels,
                    gyroscope) as the input and used the camera as a global reference for the update stage. Variance in
                    update measuement adapted for motion blur. Presented in poster format at Merrimack College Research
                    and Creative Achievement Conference 2025.

                        Research: Human Robot Interaction
                    </a> – Programmed a commercial social robot to performatively read stories to library patrons.
                    Designed an experiment deploying the robot into a local library to tell stories to people, gathering
                    data through an optional survey post-interaction. Conference paper in progress, presented locally in
                    poster format at Merrimack College Research and Creative Achievement Conference 2025. The poster was also displayed at
                    IMECE: Engineering Innovation for a Resilient Future 2025 in Memphis, TN, receiving the award for best poster presentation.
